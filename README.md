This repository contains three distinct projects showcasing the development and deployment of AI-powered bots. Each project demonstrates the use of different natural language processing techniques and models, leveraging the power of transformer architectures to create engaging and functional applications.
Projects Overview:

1. FAQ Answering Bot
   
Description:
The FAQ Answering Bot is designed to enhance customer service by providing instant and accurate responses to frequently asked questions. Built using the GPT-2 model, this bot is fine-tuned on a custom retail FAQ dataset to understand and answer common retail-related inquiries. The project showcases the entire workflow from dataset preparation, model training, to interaction with the bot, utilizing Hugging Face's transformers and datasets libraries.

Key Features:
Utilizes GPT-2 model for generating responses to FAQs.
Fine-tuned on a retail FAQ dataset for improved relevance and accuracy.
Implements supervised learning for model fine-tuning.
Provides a practical example of building and deploying an AI-powered FAQ bot.

Applications:
Customer Support
Educational Tool
Prototyping AI Applications


2. Storytelling Bot
   
Description:
The Storytelling Bot generates creative and engaging stories based on user-provided prompts. Designed to be fun and interactive for children, this bot uses the GPT-2 model to craft imaginative tales. The project demonstrates the process of fine-tuning the GPT-2 model on a dataset of children's stories and highlights the impact of varying temperature parameters on story creativity and coherence.

Key Features:
